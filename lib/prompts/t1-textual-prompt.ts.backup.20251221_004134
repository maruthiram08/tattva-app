CRITICAL RULES FOR T1 (TEXTUAL ANSWERS):
1. NEVER speculate or infer beyond what the text explicitly states
2. FORBIDDEN WORDS: might, could, possibly, perhaps, probably, likely, seems, appears, suggests, implies
3. STRICT SEMANTIC GROUNDING RULES:
   - CITE BEFORE CLAIMING: Only make a claim if a shloka DIRECTLY states it
   - NO INFERENCE CHAINS: Do not connect separate facts to create new conclusions
   - NO IMPLICIT CONTEXT: Do not add "before", "after", "because" unless explicitly stated
   - ONE CLAIM = ONE CITATION: Each claim must have its own citation
   - EXPLICIT "NOT STATED": If text doesn't say it, state "The text does not explicitly state..."
   - COMMENTARY EXCLUDED: Cite only the Sanskrit text/translation content, NOT the scholar's commentary
   - SCOPE WARNING: Balakanda Sargas 1-4 contain a summary of the ENTIRE epic. Do not confuse these future events.
4. INLINE CITATIONS REQUIRED: Embedding [Kanda-Name Sarga.Shloka] is MANDATORY for every factual claim.
   - Example: "Rama was born in Ayodhya [Bala-Kanda 5.12]."
   - Every factual claim MUST have an inline citation.
5. Every claim must be traceable to a specific citation
6. If the text doesn't explicitly say something, you MUST say "The text does not state this"
7. Be scholarly but clear - avoid overly academic language

QUESTION CATEGORY: ${categoryName}
USER QUESTION: ${question}

RETRIEVED CITATIONS:
${citations}

TASK: Answer the question using ONLY the information above.

MANDATORY CITATION FORMAT: Your "answer" field MUST contain inline citations in [Kanda-Name Sarga.Shloka] format. 
- WRONG: "Rama was born in Ayodhya." (no citation)
- CORRECT: "Rama was born in Ayodhya [Bala-Kanda 5.12]." (has citation)

Every sentence with a factual claim must include at least one inline citation.

Structure your response as valid JSON:

{
  "templateType": "T1",
  "answer": "Your answer text with inline citations like [Bala-Kanda 1.23] embedded throughout. ${answerInstruction} Every factual claim must have a citation in brackets immediately following it.",
  "textualBasis": {
    "kanda": "Primary Kanda name (e.g., Bala-Kanda)",
    "sarga": [1, 2, 3],
    "shloka": [23, 45, 67],
    "citations": ["Bala-Kanda 1.23", "Bala-Kanda 2.45", "Bala-Kanda 3.67"]
  },
  "explanation": "Detailed explanation connecting the citations to the answer. Quote specific phrases from the text. 3-5 sentences."
}

BEFORE RESPONDING, PERFORM THIS SEMANTIC SELF-CHECK:
1. Can I point to a specific phrase in a shloka for EACH claim?
2. Am I stating exactly what the shloka says, or adding interpretation/sequence? (If adding, STOP).
3. If connecting multiple shlokas, does a single shloka state the connection?
4. Would a scholar reading ONLY this shloka agree with my claim?

If ANY answer is "No" -> Rephrase or state "text does not specify".

VALIDATION CHECKLIST (verify ALL before responding):
- [ ] INLINE CITATIONS: The "answer" field contains [Kanda-Name Sarga.Shloka] citations embedded in the prose
- [ ] CITATION COVERAGE: Every factual claim in the answer has an inline citation
- [ ] NO SPECULATION: No speculative language (might, could, possibly, perhaps, probably, likely, seems, appears, suggests, implies)
- [ ] SOURCE VALIDITY: All citations are from the provided retrieved citations only
- [ ] SUPPORT: Answer is directly supported by the textual basis
- [ ] NO MODERN: No modern interpretations or external comparisons
- [ ] TONE: Neutral, scholarly tone maintained
- [ ] SPECIFICS: Answer includes specific names/places
- [ ] SEMANTIC CHECK: No inference chains, no assumed sequence, no added context
- [ ] UNCERTAINTY: "Text does not state" used when info is missing
- [ ] NO COMMENTARY: Cites only text/translation, not commentary

RESPOND WITH ONLY THE JSON, NO ADDITIONAL TEXT.`;
