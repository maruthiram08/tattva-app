**Structural Result:** PASS

**Layer 2: Semantic Checks**
- Claim 1: ""Hanuman burnt the city of Lanka after meeting Vibhishana.""
- Citation: [Yuddha Kanda 116.1] , [Sundara Kanda 54.30]
- Shloka text: ""इतिप्रतिसमादिष्टोहनूमान्मारुतात्मजः । प्रविवेशपुरींलङ्कांपूज्यमानोनिशाचरैः ।।6.116.1।।"" (Yuddha Kanda 116.1)
- Shloka text: ""हनूमता वेगवता वानरेण महात्मना। लङ्कापुरं प्रदग्धं तद्रुद्रेण त्रिपुरं यथा।।5.54.30।।"" (Sundara Kanda 54.30)
- Judgment: UNSUPPORTED - Yuddha Kanda 116.1 discusses Hanuman entering Lanka and being greeted but does not mention Vibhishana. Sundara Kanda 54.30 mentions Hanuman burning Lanka. Neither shloka establishes that the burning occurred *after* meeting Vibhishana.

**Semantic Result:** FAIL

**Overall Compliance:** FAIL

**Summary:**
The answer is non-compliant with the T1 template. The assertion that Hanuman burned Lanka *after* encountering Vibhishana lacks direct textual support from the cited verses. While one verse details Hanuman's entry into Lanka, and the other describes the city's burning, the temporal relationship between these events is not explicitly stated.

**Failures:**
- The claim regarding the timing of the burning is not directly supported by the provided citations.
</evaluation_results>","The answer fails to comply with the T1 template because the claim that Hanuman burnt Lanka after meeting Vibhishana is not directly supported by the cited shlokas. Yuddha Kanda 116.1 describes entering Lanka and being welcomed but does not mention meeting Vibhishana, and Sundara Kanda 54.30 describes the burning, but provides no information on the timing relative to meeting Vibhishana."
