- Citations Section: PASS - Explicitly states ""Citations: None""

**Structural Result:** PASS

**Layer 2: Semantic Checks** (T1 only)
- Claim: ""The text does not explicitly state how Rama identified Luv and Kush. Based on the available text, there is no mention of such an event in the provided citations.""
- Citation: None
- Shloka text: N/A
- Judgment: SUPPORTED - Since the text explicitly denies the presence of this information and correctly cites ""None.""

**Semantic Result:** PASS

**Failures:** None
</evaluation_results>","The response adheres to the T1 template requirements by providing a clear answer, explicitly stating the absence of the requested information within the provided context, and including an empty citation section.
