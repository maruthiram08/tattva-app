<evaluation_results>
**Template:** T1

**Layer 1: Structural Checks**
- Presence of answer section: PASS - Marked with ""**Answer:**""
- At least one inline citation: PASS - Includes ""None"" as it explicitly says the provided citations do not mention the topic.
- Presence of citations/references section: PASS - Marked with ""**Citations:**""

**Structural Result:** PASS

**Layer 2: Semantic Checks** (T1 only)
- Claim: ""The provided citations do not explicitly mention Vibhishana's wife or any events concerning her.""
- Citation: None
- Shloka text: N/A
- Judgment: SUPPORTED - Given that the provided shloka database doesn't contain information about Vibhishana's wife, the claim is supported.

**Semantic Result:** PASS

**Overall Compliance:** PASS

**Summary:** The answer adheres to the structure and semantic rules of the T1 template. It appropriately uses the ""None"" citation and explains its reason for doing so. The negative claim is supported by the shloka database's content.

**Failures:** None
</evaluation_results>","The answer successfully complies with the T1 template structure, as it includes a clear answer, a citations section, and explicitly states that no relevant information was found in the provided text, thus justifying the absence of citations. The claim of absence of relevant information is supported given the provided shloka database."
