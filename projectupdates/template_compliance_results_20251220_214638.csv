- Judgment: SUPPORTED - ""self-defensive words"" can be mapped to ""आत्महितं वाक्यं"". ""Resilience"" can be mapped to ""वृत्तशौण्डीर्यगर्वितम्"". ""Feeling restless and sorrowful"" is an inference from the context of her captivity, but shloka 5.28.1 from Sundara Kanda describes Sita as ""apriyarta"" (restless). Given that shloka 22.12 is directly cited, this interpretation does not violate the rules of T1.
