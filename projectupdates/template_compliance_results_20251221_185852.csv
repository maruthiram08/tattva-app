- Claim: ""The verse describes the composition of a verse by Maharishi Valmiki inspired by sorrow. It refers to a sloka consisting of four lines, each with an equal number of syllables, and rhythmically composed resembling musical accompaniment [Bala-Kanda 2.18]""
- Citation: [Bala-Kanda 2.18]
- Shloka text: पादबद्धोऽक्षरसमस्तन्त्रीलयसमन्वित: । शोकार्तस्य प्रवृत्तो मे श्लोको भवतु नान्यथा ।।1.2.18।।
- Judgment: SUPPORTED - ""शोकार्तस्य"" (of the sorrowful), ""पादबद्धोऽक्षरसम:"" (with feet/lines bound by equal syllables), ""तन्त्रीलयसमन्वित:"" (tuned to stringed instrument rhythm) all support the claim.

- Claim: ""The deity Brahma affirms to Valmiki that he indeed has composed a sloka and there should be no doubt about it [Bala-Kanda 2.30]""
- Citation: [Bala-Kanda 2.30]
- Shloka text: तमुवाच ततो ब्रह्मा प्रहसन्मुनिपुङ्गवम् । श्लोक एव त्वया बद्धो नात्र कार्या विचारणा ।।1.2.30।।
- Judgment: SUPPORTED - ""श्लोक एव त्वया बद्धो नात्र कार्या विचारणा"" (You have indeed composed a sloka, there is no need for doubt here).

- Claim: ""Furthermore, the continued recitation of this neatly structured sloka, admired for its form, is acknowledged as glorious [Bala-Kanda 2.40].""
- Citation: [Bala-Kanda 2.40]
- Shloka text: ﻿﻿समाक्षरैश्चतुर्भिर्य: पादैर्गीतो महर्षिणा । सोऽनुव्याहरणाद्भूयश्श्लोकश्श्लोकत्वमागत: ।।1.2.40।।
- Judgment: SUPPORTED - ""अनुव्याहरणात् भूयः श्लोकत्वमागत:"" (By repeated recitation, it attained gloriousness as a sloka) supports the idea of it becoming glorious through recitation. The description as ""neatly structured"" and ""admired for its form"" are reasonable interpretations of ""समाक्षरैश्चतुर्भिर्य: पादैर्गीतो"" (composed of four parts with equal syllables), though not direct quotes.

- Claim: ""Verses in Valmiki's Ramayana can be misinterpreted when words seem to convey dual meanings. In the instance when Rama is replying to Vali, who is mortally wounded and confused, the words are described as being both courteous and harsh [Kishkindha Kanda 18.1]. Another key element is seen when Vali, upon gaining clarity, is consoled by Rama's words that reflect peace and righteousness [Kishkindha Kanda 18.60]. Such dual interpretations can lead to misinterpretations of the original intentions behind the text, as similar words can seem contradictory or open to multiple understandings.""

- Claim 1: ""Rama is replying to Vali, who is mortally wounded and confused, the words are described as being both courteous and harsh""
- Citation: Kishkindha Kanda 18.1
- Shloka text: ""इत्युक्तः प्रश्रितं वाक्यं धर्मार्थसहितं हितम्। परुषं वालिना रामो निहतेन विचेतसा4.18.1।। रामः Rama, निहतेन struck, विचेतसा confused in mind, वालिना Vali, धर्मार्थसहितम् righteous, हितम् wellmeaning, प्रश्रितम् courteous, परुषम् harsh, वाक्यम् words, इति these, उक्तः said.""
- Judgment: SUPPORTED - The shloka mentions that Rama's words to the confused (विचेतसा) Vali were both courteous (प्रश्रितम्) and harsh (परुषम्).

- Claim 2: ""Vali, upon gaining clarity, is consoled by Rama's words that reflect peace and righteousness""
- Citation: Kishkindha Kanda 18.60
- Shloka text: ""स तमाश्वासयद्रामो वालिनं व्यक्तदर्शनम्4.18.60।। सामसम्पन्नया वाचा धर्मतत्त्वार्थयुक्तया। सः रामः Rama, व्यक्तदर्शनम् him who saw clearly, तं वालिनम् that Vali, सामसम्पन्नया for peace and tranquillity, धर्मतत्त्वार्थयुक्तया reflecting truth and righteousness, वाचा with words, आश्वासयत् he consoled.""
- Judgment: SUPPORTED - The shloka states that Rama consoled Vali ( आश्वासयत् he consoled), who saw clearly (व्यक्तदर्शनम्), with words reflecting peace and righteousness (सामसम्पन्नया वाचा धर्मतत्त्वार्थयुक्तया).

- Claim 3: ""Verses in Valmiki's Ramayana can be misinterpreted when words seem to convey dual meanings.
