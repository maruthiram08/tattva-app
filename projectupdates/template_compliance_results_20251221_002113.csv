- Claim: ""The text does not provide an explicit account of the Vedashruti river crossing in the retrieved citations.""
- Citation: [Ayodhya Kanda 55.5]
- Shloka text: ""अथाऽसाद्य तु कालिन्दी शीघ्रस्रोतसमापगाम्। तस्यास्तीर्थं प्रचलितं पुराणं प्रेक्ष्य राघवौ।।2.55.5।। तत्र यूयं प्लवं कृत्वा तरतांशुमतीं नदीम्।""
- Judgment: SUPPORTED - While the shloka does not directly state this, the claim that *no explicit mention of Vedashruti river crossing is made in the retrieved citations* is true. The provided shloka doesn't mention Vedashruti. Since this statement pertains to what *is not* present, it's acceptable given the limited scope of the citation provided.

- Claim: ""The specific river crossing events mentioned include the crossing of the Yamuna river by Rama and Lakshmana where they created a raft to cross the river""
- Citation: [Ayodhya Kanda 55.5]
- Shloka text: ""अथाऽसाद्य तु कालिन्दी शीघ्रस्रोतसमापगाम्। तस्यास्तीर्थं प्रचलितं पुराणं प्रेक्ष्य राघवौ।।2.55.5।। तत्र यूयं प्लवं कृत्वा तरतांशुमतीं नदीम्।""
- Judgment: SUPPORTED - This is a correct summary of the provided shloka.

- Citation: [Ayodhya Kanda 55.5]
- Shloka text: ""अथाऽसाद्य तु कालिन्दी शीघ्रस्रोतसमापगाम्। तस्यास्तीर्थं प्रचलितं पुराणं प्रेक्ष्य राघवौ।।2.55.5।। तत्र यूयं प्लवं कृत्वा तरतांशुमतीं नदीम्।""
- Judgment: SUPPORTED - Same reasoning as the first claim, since the shloka doesn't mention these other rivers.

- Claim: ""The Ocean (Sagara) finally appeared before Rama because of the fear of punishment and the desire to witness the building of the bridge""
- Citation: [Yuddha Kanda 22.48]
- Shloka text: ""अयंहिसागरोभीमस्सेतुकर्मदिदृक्ष्याः । ददौदण्डभयाद्गाधंराघवायमहोदधिः ।।6.22.48।। Translation: भी?: fearsome, अयंहि I also, सागरः ocean, महोदधिः mighty ocean, दण्डभयात् fear of punishment, सेतुकर्मदिदृक्ष्या to witness the building of a bridge, राघवाय to Rama, गाधम् place, ददौ allowed a passage.""
- Judgment: SUPPORTED - The shloka directly supports the claim that the ocean appeared due to fear of punishment and desire to witness the bridge.

- Claim: ""This passage allowed Rama to continue his efforts to reach Lanka""
- Citation: [Yuddha Kanda 128.10]
- Shloka text: ""उपयानंसमुद्रस्यसागरस्य च दर्शनम् । यथा च कारितस्सेतूरावणश्चयथाहतः ।।6.128.10।। Translation: समुद्रस्य ocean's, उपयानम् going near, सागरस्य ocean, दर्शनं च appearing before me, सेतुः, यथा so also, कारितः bridge, रावणश्च Ravana, यथा so also, हतः killed""
- Judgment: SUPPORTED - This shloka references the events of approaching the ocean, seeing the ocean appear, building the bridge, and Ravana's death. The claim is reasonably supported by this shloka, since building the bridge led to the victory.

- Claim: ""The great ocean, having been excavated by King Sagara, recognized its obligation to assist Rama, who belonged to the same race""
- Citation: [Yuddha Kanda 19.31]
- Shloka text: ""खानितस्सगरेणायमप्रमेयोमहोदधिः । कर्तुमर्हतिरामस्यज्ञाते: कार्यंमहामतिः ।।6.19.31।। Translation: आप्रमेयः unbounded, अयम: this, महोदधिः great ocean, सगरेण: by Sagara, खनितः excavated, महामतिः king of the great ocean, ज्ञात: race, रामस्य: Rama's, कार्यम् task, कर्तुम् to do, अर्हति: ought to.""
- Judgment: SUPPORTED - This shloka supports that the ocean, excavated by Sagara, ought to assist Rama because of their shared lineage.

- Claim: ""Thus, compelled by fear and a sense of duty, Sagara gave a passage to Rama""
- Citation: [Yuddha Kanda 22.48]
- Shloka text: ""अयंहिसागरोभीमस्सेतुकर्मदिदृक्ष्याः । ददौदण्डभयाद्गाधंराघवायमहोदधिः ।।6.22.48।। Translation: भीमः fearsome, अयंहि I also, सागरः ocean, महोदधिः mighty ocean, दण्डभयात् fear of punishment, सेतुकर्मदिदृक्ष्या to witness the building of a bridge, राघवाय to Rama, गाधम् place, ददौ allowed a passage.""
- Judgment: SUPPORTED - This shloka supports the ocean giving passage due to fear. The ""sense of duty"" aspect isn't explicitly mentioned but it can be inferred from [Yuddha Kanda 19.31]
