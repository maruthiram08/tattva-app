- Unsupported claim by cited shloka (Ayodhya Kanda 100.76)
- Unsupported connection of Ayodhya Kanda 67.38 to the Ramayana conclusion.
</evaluation_results>","The answer fails to comply with the T1 template due to a missing citations/references section and unsupported claims by cited shlokas. Specifically, the claim about the ending of Ayodhya Kanda is not supported by shloka 100.76. Additionally, Ayodhya Kanda 67.38 doesn't address the Ramayana conclusion."
2,In which section does Valmiki describe the origin of the Sloka meter?,openai,T1,FAIL,PASS,FAIL,"- Missing Citations/References section.
</evaluation_results>","The answer generally complies with the semantic rules of T1, with claims supported by cited shlokas. The main failure is the lack of a dedicated ""Citations"" or ""References"" section, which is a structural requirement. The phrase ""first of its kind"" is interpretive and could be seen as a failure."

</evaluation_results>","The answer provides a factually correct response supported by shlokas. However, it fails to comply with the structural requirements of the T1 template because it lacks a ""Citations/References"" section."

- Semantic: Claims about Hanuman meeting Vibhishana and the sequence of events are not directly supported by cited shlokas.
</evaluation_results>","The answer attempts to follow the T1 template, but fails structurally because it lacks a clearly labeled citations section. More importantly, it makes claims that are not directly supported by the cited verses, thereby failing semantically. The sequence of events and Hanuman being commanded by Vibhishana are not explicitly stated."
5,"When did Indrajit use the Brahmastra? Was it the first, second, or third encounter?",openai,T1,FAIL,PASS,FAIL,"- Missing Citations/References section
</evaluation_results>","The answer provides a factual summary of Indrajit's use of divine weapons as described in the Ramayana, supported by cited shlokas. The structural requirement for a dedicated Citations/References section is missing.

- Citation: Yuddha Kanda 85.18
