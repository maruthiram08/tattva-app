Hanuman notably crossed the ocean effortlessly to reach Lanka and see Sita, demonstrating his extraordinary abilities (Sundara Kanda 35.70, 56.34).

Surpanakha, sister to the demon king Ravana, encountered Rama during his exile and was deformed by Lakshmana (Bala Kanda 1.46). Afflicted and enraged, Surpanakha sought Ravana's help (Yuddha Kanda 129.21). She sparked Ravana's interest in Sita, leading him to plot her abduction by enlisting Maricha to lure Rama and Lakshmana away using a golden deer (Yuddha Kanda 129.22). This act of kidnapping Sita initiated a profound enmity between Rama and Ravana, setting the course for the ensuing conflict (Yuddha Kanda 95.11).

After being rejected and deformed by Lakshmana (Bala Kanda 1.46), she reported to Ravana, igniting his interest in Sita (Aranya Kanda 20.1). Her actions ultimately led to the demon king's decision to abduct Sita, as he devised a plan involving Maricha to allure Sita using a deceptive golden deer (Yuddha Kanda 129.22). This abduction caused a profound enmity, as Ravana's desire for Sita and actions led to his kingdom's eventual ruin (Yuddha Kanda 95.11, Sundara Kanda 5.3.49).
