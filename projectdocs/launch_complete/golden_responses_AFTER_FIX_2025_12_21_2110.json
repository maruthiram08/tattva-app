The fire god acted as a witness to Sita's sinlessness, declaring that she did not know any sin [Yuddha-Kanda 121.5]. Rama was exceedingly pleased to know of Sita’s sinless nature through the testimony of the fire god, which the gods also adored [Bala-Kanda 1.83]. Sita herself declared that if her heart had never abandoned Rama, and if she had always followed a righteous path, the fire god and the world would witness her purity, seeking protection from the fire [Yuddha-Kanda 119.25, Yuddha-Kanda 119.27].",

      "answer": "One interpretation is that Rama justified the 'Agni Pariksha' as a necessary test of Sita's purity and faithfulness, given the circumstances of her abduction by the demon Ravana. The text suggests that Rama was tormented by Sita's disappearance and sought to assuage his doubts about her fidelity, though he initially refused to take her to the forest due to the hardships of forest life [Ayodhya-Kanda 28.1].\n\n**Textual Basis:**\nThe text explicitly states that when Rama returned from exile, he was \"tormented and emaciated due to Sita's abduction, resembling the fire at the time of dissolution of the creation, ready to destroy the world\" [Aranya-Kanda 65.1-2]. It also describes how Rama \"looked at his bow strung again and again, breathing hot sighs like Lord Siva at the end of the creation, wishing to burn down the world in a rage\" [Aranya-Kanda 65.2]. This suggests Rama was deeply troubled by Sita's disappearance and sought to reestablish her purity.\n\n**Interpretations:**\nScholars have interpreted the 'Agni Pariksha' as Rama's way of publicly restoring Sita's honor and reputation after her abduction by Ravana. Commentators note that Rama was bound by his duty as a righteous king to ensure the purity of his queen, even though he privately never doubted Sita's fidelity [Yuddha-Kanda 121.1]. The text can be understood as portraying Rama's anguish at having to subject Sita to this ordeal despite his love for her.\n\n**Limit of Certainty:**\nWhile the text describes Rama's words and actions, it does not fully reveal his internal emotional state or the reasoning behind his decision to subject Sita to the 'Agni Pariksha'. The text remains ambiguous on whether Rama truly doubted Sita's purity or if he performed this ritual for public perception as the righteous king. Alternative interpretations suggest Rama acted primarily to restore Sita's reputation, rather than out of personal doubt.",

        "answer": "One interpretation is that Rama justified the 'Agni Pariksha' as a necessary test of Sita's purity and faithfulness, given the circumstances of her abduction by the demon Ravana. The text suggests that Rama was tormented by Sita's disappearance and sought to assuage his doubts about her fidelity, though he initially refused to take her to the forest due to the hardships of forest life [Ayodhya-Kanda 28.1].\n\n**Textual Basis:**\nThe text explicitly states that when Rama returned from exile, he was \"tormented and emaciated due to Sita's abduction, resembling the fire at the time of dissolution of the creation, ready to destroy the world\" [Aranya-Kanda 65.1-2]. It also describes how Rama \"looked at his bow strung again and again, breathing hot sighs like Lord Siva at the end of the creation, wishing to burn down the world in a rage\" [Aranya-Kanda 65.2]. This suggests Rama was deeply troubled by Sita's disappearance and sought to reestablish her purity.\n\n**Interpretations:**\nScholars have interpreted the 'Agni Pariksha' as Rama's way of publicly restoring Sita's honor and reputation after her abduction by Ravana. Commentators note that Rama was bound by his duty as a righteous king to ensure the purity of his queen, even though he privately never doubted Sita's fidelity [Yuddha-Kanda 121.1]. The text can be understood as portraying Rama's anguish at having to subject Sita to this ordeal despite his love for her.\n\n**Limit of Certainty:**\nWhile the text describes Rama's words and actions, it does not fully reveal his internal emotional state or the reasoning behind his decision to subject Sita to the 'Agni Pariksha'. The text remains ambiguous on whether Rama truly doubted Sita's purity or if he performed this ritual for public perception as the righteous king. Alternative interpretations suggest Rama acted primarily to restore Sita's reputation, rather than out of personal doubt.",
